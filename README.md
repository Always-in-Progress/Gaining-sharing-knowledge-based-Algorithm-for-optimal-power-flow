# Gaining-sharing-knowledge-based-Algorithm-for-optimal-power-flow
 Gaining-sharing knowledge-based algorithm is capable to obtain more diverse non-dominated solutions to MOVRPOC for distributed networks, which can be better applied to the practical scenarios on Multi-objective voltage and reactive power coordinated control distribution networks.
